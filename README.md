# Book Journal (WIP)

Website that will allow users to record their books in a similar fashion to my library inside Google Books.

Book journal allows users to record ideas, add mindmaps, and add images. The main idea behind this project is to allow users to express their ideas about the books they read in a friendly and intuitive manner.  

## How to install for local development

```

To run the frontend you need node installed. Simply run:
