# Book Journal 

Book journal is an app that allows users to record ideas about the books they have read, as well as keep track of their library of books, the books they already read and the books they are currently reading.

This application fetches data from the Google books api, allowing users to easily find the book they own or want to read and start adding ideas using the Markdown editor provided.

## How to install for local development

To run the API you need [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

```

To run the frontend you need node installed, then simply move the frontend directory and run it using npm, like the example below:
